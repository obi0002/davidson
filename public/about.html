<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is ukpai obinna davidson, i was born on the 24th january 199_ in kaduna state Nigeria. I schooled at federal 
  government college malali kaduna, met some cool and not so cool dudes in secondary school. When i was younger i always
  wanted a career in the aviation sector but the sea called me lol, maybe because i sang a song about the sea i listend 
  to in a fantasy movie lol i dunno. So i later went to a maritime school and i studied marine engineering.</p>

<p>So after i left school, should i say life happened or nigeria happened, well all i know is that alot happened story
  for another day. I later went on to become a seaman...hallelujah, but its not enough, its never enough. I always want 
  more but i can't steal and i don't want to rip anyone of their hard earned money, so this later made me learn a skill, i 
  became an unprofitable forex trader...lol yes unprofitable because i'm yet to master my emotions when trading. Now i
   am a potential web developer and that is the reason you are reading this so let see how it goes...</p>
